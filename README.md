# HOLO-AI

## 🚀 Project Overview
HOLO-AI is a smart AI-powered personal assistant designed to appear as a 3D holographic avatar, enabling more natural and immersive human–AI interaction.

This project was developed as part of the GDG TechSprint Hackathon.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Most existing AI assistants are limited to flat screens or voice-only interfaces, lacking spatial presence and human-like engagement. This reduces user involvement and effectiveness in future AI-driven environments.

---

## 💡 Solution
HOLO-AI introduces a holographic-style AI assistant represented through a digital avatar. The MVP focuses on the conversational intelligence and interaction layer, powered by Google Gemini, with holographic visualization planned as future scope.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Google Gemini API (Conversational Intelligence)
- Google Text-to-Speech (Voice Output – planned / local deployment)
- Google Speech-to-Text (Voice Input – planned)
- Firebase (Authentication & data storage – future scope)
- Google Cloud Services (Scalability – future scope)

---

## 📦 MVP Scope
### Current MVP:
- Text-based interaction with Gemini
- Real-time AI responses
- Demonstration of intelligence layer

### Future Enhancements:
- 3D avatar rendering
- Voice and gesture interaction
- Physical holographic projection
